# -OthelloBot
This was a university assignment that I made together with Axel Voss.

It is a single player Othello game versus our AI. The Ai uses the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning. The details of the program is explained in the assignment report available in this repository.

The finished project was uploaded to this repository after the completion of the assignment.
